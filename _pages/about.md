# Elizabeth Jaramillo Rojas

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. My research focuses on development and labor economics, with a particular interest in labor markets in developing countries, education, and the role of public policies in improving the lives of the poor.

I hold a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from Tilburg University, a MA in Economics, a BSc in Industrial Engineering, and a BS in Economics from Universidad de los Andes. Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank.
